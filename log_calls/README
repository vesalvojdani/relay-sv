Small library to link into a program if you want to log all function calls 
(e.g., to build a dynamic callgraph).

To build a dynamic callgraph
 - log all calls to gcc with "./scripts/intercept.sh make -e"
 - edit the outputted "stripped-log.txt" file to link in
   the logging library (single-threaded version or pthread version)
 - use the stripped-log to build w/ calls to the logger (based on
   "./cil/src/ext/logcalls2.ml" and "./scripts/log_call_from_log.sh"

If you use the multi-threaded version you may want to run the
script "separate_logs.sh" to split up each of the threads
(after you rename the thread IDs in the logs to be a
 multiple of 10 instead of random numbers)

Enjoy.
