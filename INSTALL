 Building from source 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 *) If you use Windows, you must first install cygwin. (Not tested)
    
 *) You must install OCaml version 3.08 or higher (see instructions at
    http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml).
    - Other dependencies include the M4 preprocessor

 *) Download and unpack this RELAY distribution. 

 *) Build the copy of CIL that is in the RELAY distribution
    (see the CIL INSTALL file). Note: if you get a compilation
    error "File "obj/x86_LINUX/feature_config.ml", line 4, ...",
    edit the obj/x86_LINUX/feature_config.ml file and remove the "-ne" junk.

 *) Run make in the base RELAY directory

 *) Configuration files are the *.cfg files in the RELAY directory.
    You do not need to edit them to get up and running, but if you wish
    to change where summaries are stored, edit them (e.g., edit storage.cfg)

 *) To test RELAY go to the racetest directory and "make renew_small; make".
    To test the RADAR nullpointer analysis go to nulltests directory.
    Other tests (callgraph analysis tests) are found in a separate tarball.

 7. Optional: the web UI for browsing warnings requires installation
    of the Django web framework and a database backend, and editing
    ui/relay/setting.py, etc... Very raw right now.
